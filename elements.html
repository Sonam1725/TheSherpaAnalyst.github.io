									<p><i>I was born in Nepal in 1998. However, I spent most of my life in the United States of America after moving there at the age of 7. After graduating from Santa Rosa High School in 2016, I decided to stay in state and attend the San Jose State University. After 4 years, I graduated in 2020 from San Jose State University with the Bacholor of Science in Kinesiology in hope of attending Doctor of Physical Therapy School. Although, I graduated with a Kinesiology degree(concentration on Pre-Physical Therapy), I decided to take a different career path when I took the Google Data Analytics Course in Coursera and feel in love of the idea of analytics. Never before had I realized how much data there are and how much data we are producing each second in the world. One of the reason I feel in love with the field of data analysis, was the vast career opportunities that it can provide. Data Analysis is one of the only field of study that is involved with every other subject domains, from real estate, sports, finance, movie industy and etc.</i></p>
